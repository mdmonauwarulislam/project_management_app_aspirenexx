## Usage

### Adding a New Task
Click the "New Task" button to open a modal where you can fill out the task details and save it.

### Clearing All Tasks
Click the "Clear" button to remove all tasks from the list and local storage.

### Searching for Tasks
Use the search input to filter tasks by their titles.

### Sorting Tasks
Use the sort options to organize tasks by criteria such as date, priority, etc.

## Customization

### Tailwind CSS
You can customize the styling by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes in the components. Tailwind's utility-first approach makes it easy to change the design without leaving the HTML.

### Redux Store
The state management logic is located in `src/redux/features/task-board-slice.js`. You can add new actions, reducers, and selectors to extend the app's functionality.
